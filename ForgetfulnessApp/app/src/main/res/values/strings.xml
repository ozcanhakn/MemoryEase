    <string name="aerobic_text1">Aerobic exercise is particularly good for the brain, so choose activities that keep your blood pumping. In general, anything that is good for your heart is great for your brain.</string>
    <string name="aerobic_text2">Does it take you a long time to clear out the sleep fog when you wake up? If so, you may find that exercising in the morning before you start your day makes a big difference. In addition to clearing away the cobwebs, it also primes you for learning throughout the day.</string>
    <string name="aerobic_text3">Physical activities that require hand-eye coordination or complex motor skills are particularly beneficial for brain building.</string>
    <string name="aerobic_text4">Exercise breaks can help you get past mental fatigue and afternoon slumps. Even a short walk or a few jumping jacks can be enough to reboot your brain.</string>


    <string name="meditation_text1">The practice of meditation may positively affect your health in many ways.</string>
    <string name="meditation_text2">It is relaxing and soothing, and has been found to reduce stress and pain, lower blood pressure and even improve memory (8Trusted Source).</string>
    <string name="meditation_text3">In fact, meditation has been shown to increase gray matter in the brain. Gray matter contains neuron cell bodies.</string>
    <string name="meditation_text4">As you age, gray matter declines, which negatively impacts memory and cognition.</string>
    <string name="meditation_text5">Meditation and relaxation techniques have been shown to improve short-term memory in people of all ages, from people in their 20s to older adults.</string>
    <string name="meditation_text6">For example, one study showed that Taiwanese college students who engaged in meditation practices like mindfulness had significantly better spatial working memory than students who did not practice meditation.</string>
    <string name="meditation_text7">Spatial working memory is the ability to hold and process information in your mind about the positions of objects in space.</string>

    <string name="sleep_text1">Lack of proper sleep has been associated with poor memory for quite some time.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text2">Sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation, a process in which short-term memories are strengthened and transformed into long-lasting memories.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text3">Research shows that if you’re sleep deprived, you could be negatively impacting your memory.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text4">For example, one study looked at the effects of sleep in 40 children between ages 10 and 14 years.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text5">One group of children was trained for memory tests in the evening, then tested the following morning after a night’s sleep. The other group was trained and tested on the same day, with no sleep between training and testing.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text6">The group that slept between training and testing performed 20% better on the memory tests.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text7">Another study found that nurses working the night shift made more mathematical errors and that 68% of them scored lower on memory tests compared with nurses working the day shift.</string>
    <string name="sleep_text8">Health experts recommend adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each night for optimal health.</string>

    <string name="question_meditation">Meditation isn’t just good for your body it’s also good for your brain. Research suggests meditation may increase gray matter in the brain and improve spatial working memory.</string>
    <string name="question_exercise"> Exercise brings incredible benefits for your whole body, including your brain. Even moderate exercise for short periods has been shown to improve cognitive performance, including memory, across all age groups.</string>
    <string name="question_sleep">Studies have consistently associated sufficient sleep with better memory performance. Sleep helps consolidate memories. You’re also likely to perform better on memory tests if you’re well rested than if you’re sleep deprived.</string>
    <string name="question_crossword">Games that challenge your brain may help you strengthen your memory and may even reduce the risk of dementia.</string>

    <string name="abouttheteam1">We\'re Hakan Ozcan and Mustafa Yildiz the crew behind MemoryEase. Here\'s the tale of how it came to be, and our philosophy for building it.</string>
    <string name="abouttheteam2">In fact, we suffered from forgetfulness many times during the day. When we thought about how we could prevent this problem, we actually laid the foundations of MemoryEase.</string>
    <string name="abouttheteam3">We thought we could do better by making something obvius: an app that showed only the most important info in one straightforward page.</string>
    <string name="abouttheteam4">We looked at various apps, searched for advice, but nothing was enough</string>
    <string name="abouttheteam5">We spent a long time testing, gathering information, getting advice from people who suffered from the same problem, and after a long development process, MemoryEase was born</string>
    <string name="abouttheteam6">We launched version 1.0 for Android in late 2023.</string>

    <string name="content">With the idea of imparting programming
      knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT Roorkee alumnus started a
      dream, GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming excites you or you feel
      stifled, wondering how to prepare for interview questions or how to
      ace data structures and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a one-stop solution.
      With every tick of time, we are adding arrows in our quiver. From articles
      on various computer science subjects to programming problems for practice,
      from basic to premium courses, from technologies to entrance examinations,
      we have been building ample content with superior quality. In a short span,
      we have built a community of 1 Million+ Geeks around the world, 20,000+
      Contributors and 500+ Campus Ambassadors in various colleges across the nation.
      Our success stories include a lot of students who benefitted in their placements
      and landed jobs at tech giants. Our vision is to build a gigantic network of
      geeks and we are only a fraction of it yet.
